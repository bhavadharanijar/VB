hi everyone
The chat text can be given in the input box provided at the bottom of the chat window. 
While clicking the Send button, it starts executing function set_chat_msg. 
It is an Ajax based function so that without refreshing the page, it can send the chat text to the server.
In the server, it executes chat_send_ajax.php along with the username and chat text.
